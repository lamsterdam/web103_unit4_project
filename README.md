## Notes

Features JavaScript, React, Vite, Express, Node.js and PostgreSQL

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.
I spent a good amount of time working on the backend and finally landed on using multiple foreign keys. I also had some challenges with my routing and had to create additional controllers for each customization category. Finally the frontend pages took a very long time to assemble so I did not get to dedicate more time to cleaning them up.
